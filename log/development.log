NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true
 (called from <top (required)> at /home/syed/Documents/workspace/Art/config/environment.rb:5)

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`

boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

[ActiveJob] [ActionMailer::DeliveryJob] [b5b38900-f25e-46fe-9e1b-5e42d80e7044] Performed ActionMailer::DeliveryJob (Job ID: b5b38900-f25e-46fe-9e1b-5e42d80e7044) from Async(mailers) in 1616.34ms
DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:

  Rails.application.config.active_record.sqlite3.represent_boolean_as_integer = true

DEPRECATION WARNING: Leaving `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter.represent_boolean_as_integer`
set to false is deprecated. SQLite databases have used 't' and 'f' to serialize
boolean values and must have old data converted to 1 and 0 (its native boolean
serialization) before setting this flag to true. Conversion can be accomplished
by setting up a rake task which runs

  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 't'").update_all(boolean_column: 1)
  ExampleModel.where("boolean_column = 'f'").update_all(boolean_column: 0)

for all models and all boolean columns, after which the flag must be set to
true by adding the following to your application.rb file:
